# ETL-with-Airflow
This project builds a data pipeline to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data for Sparkify, a fictional music streaming company. The pipeline processes two datasets stored in Amazon S3, performs transformations to create a data warehouse with 4 dimensions and 1 fact table, and loads the final tables into Amazon Redshift. The entire workflow is orchestrated using Apache Airflow.
